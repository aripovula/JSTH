addrule = - to add a simple card just add question and answer text and indicate type, framework and topic.\r\n- to add a card where more than one question and answers exist please add first question in 'Question' field and add all remaining parts in 'Answer' text field and separate each question and answer with '$%'\r\nExample: in 'Question' field add ' Is ABC part of XYZ ? ' and in 'Answer' field add:\r\nYes, it is part of XYZ\r\nWhy ABC should be part of XYZ ? $% \r\nBecause ... ( explanation ) ...\r\n\r\nThis way after displaying the first answer the app will display also the second question (all text up to '$%') and will not display second answer (part coming after '$%') until you hit 'Next' button. The number of times you can use '$%' in one card is not limited.\r\n\r\nYou can view or edit cards that were added by you. You have 'read only' access to cards that were added by administrator of this site. Cards added by other users are not accessible to you.
